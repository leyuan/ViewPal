                        The key to micropayments is execution. With ViewPal, we focus on creating a low-friction way for people to upload money to their account. To accomplish this, we work with various APIs and companies to leverage places people already have their credit card entered. For example, iTunes, Google, PayPal and more. We also enable people to pay using their mobile devices. The bill is simply added onto their monthly phone bill. 
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        The second important thing for micropayments to work is the messaging. We have worked hard to find the perfect ways of asking people to open their wallets. For example, when people are asked to support the writers who create a blog, versus simply hit with a paywall, the differences in conversion is significant. When you sign up, we ask that you specify the type of content that you provide. In this way, our software can determine the best messaging based on similar content providers. Our customer service department works with each and every client to ensure a perfect fit between messaging and your unique company’s personality. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third key to success revolves around price point. Charging too much scares your audience off, but charging too little fails to maximize revenue. We provide suggested price points based on what is working on similar websites, but ultimately the decision on price is up to you, and you are free to make adjustments from your online dashboard.
